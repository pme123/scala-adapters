## Use Case
The Use Case comes from my daily job with [screenfoodnet](https://www.screenfoodnet.com/de/).

* CMS: Our existing CMS.
* adapters-CMS: A unified interface for all adapters to access the CMS.
* adapters: A small framework to provide the general adapter functionality.
* customer adapter: Here goes the customer specific code.
* customer system: The system we want to integrate with.

* **adapters**
* **customer adapter** > will be the examples.
