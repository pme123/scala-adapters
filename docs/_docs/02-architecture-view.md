# A Scala Full Stack
As a server developer I was always looking for an easy way to provide a GUI for my ideas. This stack is for now the closest I found. 

**This Wiki has the following purpose:**
* Provide a documentation for this Scala Fullstack.
* Get some experience in moving to open source. 

**The focus is on:**
* the interaction between the server and the client. 
* the client

**The documentation is organized in 4 views:**
* [Business View](https://github.com/pme123/scala-fullstack/wiki/Business-View)
* [Architecture & Design View](Architecture-&-Design-View)
* Deployment View
* [Development View](Development-View)
