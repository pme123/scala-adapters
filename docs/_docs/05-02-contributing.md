Having trouble working with the adapters? Found a typo in the documentation? Interested in adding a feature or [fixing a bug](https://github.com/pme123/scala-adapters/issues)? Then by all means [submit an issue](https://github.com/pme123/scala-adapters/issues/new) or [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/). If this is your first pull request, it may be helpful to read up on the [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) first.

Scala Adapters has been designed as a base for integrating customer's systems, but seems also to work for batch processing in general. Please keep this in mind when requesting features and/or submitting pull requests. If it's not something that most people will use, I probably won't consider it. When in doubt ask.
