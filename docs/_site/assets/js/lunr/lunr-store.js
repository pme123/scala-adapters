        "excerpt":"Minimal Mistakes has been developed as a Jekyll theme gem for easier use. It is also 100% compatible with GitHub Pages — just with slightly different installation process.Installing the ThemeIf you’re running Jekyll v3.5+ and self-hosting you can quickly install the theme as a Ruby gem.ProTip: Be sure to remove /docs and /test if you forked Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don’t want them littering up your repo.Ruby Gem MethodAdd this line to your Jekyll site’s Gemfile:gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"Add this line to your Jekyll site’s _config.yml file:theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyllThen run Bundler to install the theme gem and dependencies:bundle installGitHub Pages MethodGitHub Pages has added full support for any GitHub-hosted theme.Replace gem \"jekyll\" with:gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins\t\t\tRun bundle update and verify that all gems install properly.Add remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" to your _config.yml file. Remove any other theme: or remote_theme: entry.You may also optionally specify a branch, tag, or commit to use by appending an @ and the Git ref (e.g., mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.9.0 or mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@bbf3cbc5fd64a3e1885f3f99eb90ba92af84063d). If you don’t specify a Git ref, the master branch will be used.Note: Your Jekyll site should be viewable immediately at http://USERNAME.github.io. If it’s not, you can force a rebuild by Customizing Your Site (see below for more details).If you’re hosting several Jekyll based sites under the same GitHub username you will have to use Project Pages instead of User Pages. Essentially you rename the repo to something other than USERNAME.github.io and create a gh-pages branch off of master. For more details on how to set things up check GitHub’s documentation.  You can also install the theme by copying all of the theme files1 into your project.To do so fork the Minimal Mistakes theme, then rename the repo to USERNAME.github.io — replacing USERNAME with your GitHub username.  GitHub Pages Alternatives: Looking to host your site for free and install/update the theme painlessly? Netflify, GitLab Pages, and Continuous Integration (CI) services have you covered. In most cases all you need to do is connect your repository to them, create a simple configuration file, and install the theme following the Ruby Gem Method above.Remove the UnnecessaryIf you forked or downloaded the minimal-mistakes-jekyll repo you can safely remove the following folders and files:  .editorconfig  .gitattributes  .github  /docs  /test  CHANGELOG.md  minimal-mistakes-jekyll.gemspec  README.md  screenshot-layouts.png  screenshot.pngSetup Your SiteDepending on the path you took installing Minimal Mistakes you’ll setup things a little differently.ProTip: The source code and content files for this site can be found in the /docs folder if you want to copy or learn from them.Starting FreshStarting with an empty folder and Gemfile you’ll need to copy or re-create this default _config.yml file. For a full explanation of every setting be sure to read the Configuration section.From v4.5.0 onwards, Minimal Mistakes theme-gem comes bundled with the necessary data files and will automatically use them via the jekyll-data plugin. So you no longer need to maintain a copy of these data files at your project directory.However like all other bundled files, you’ll need to create and edit these data files to customize them.The bundled data files are:  _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation  _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentationStarting from jekyll newScaffolding out a site with the jekyll new command requires you to modify a few files that it creates.Edit _config.yml. Then:  Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.md with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html. Be sure to enable pagination if using the home layout by adding the necessary lines to _config.yml.  Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.  Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using it).Migrating to Gem VersionIf you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the theme files things upgrading will be easier for you.Start by removing the following folders and any files within them:├── _includes├── _layouts├── _sass├── assets|  ├── css|  ├── fonts|  └── jsYou won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled with the theme gem — unless you intend to override them.Note: When clearing out the assets folder be sure to leave any files you’ve added and need. This includes images, CSS, or JavaScript that aren’t already bundled in the theme.From v4.5.0 onwards, you don’t have to maintain a copy of the default data files viz. _data/ui-text.yml and _data/navigation.yml either.The default files are read-in automatically via the jekyll-data plugin.If you customized any of these files leave them alone, and only remove the untouched ones. If done correctly your modified versions should override the versions bundled with the theme and be used by Jekyll instead.Update GemfileReplace gem \"github-pages or gem \"jekyll\" with gem \"jekyll\", \"~&gt; 3.5\". You’ll need the latest version of Jekyll2 for Minimal Mistakes to work and load all of the theme’s assets properly, this line forces Bundler to do that.Add the Minimal Mistakes theme gem:gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"When finished your Gemfile should look something like this:source \"https://rubygems.org\"gem \"jekyll\", \"~&gt; 3.5\"gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"Then run bundle update and add theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyll to your _config.yml.v4 Breaking Change: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: /assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now /assets/images/ but can be placed elsewhere or externally hosted. This applies to image references in _config.yml and author.yml as well.That’s it! If all goes well running bundle exec jekyll serve should spin-up your site.            See Structure page for a list of theme files and what they do. &#8617;              You could also run bundle update jekyll to update Jekyll. &#8617;      ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Install the Theme1. For a new site, install the minimal-mistakes-jekyll theme gem or fork the Minimal Mistakes repo on GitHub following the steps outlined in the Quick-Start Guide.If you plan to host with GitHub Pages be sure to properly setup jekyll-remote-theme as it is required for the theme to work properly.2. For an existing site follow the steps outlined in the Quick-Start Guide. Then work through the guidelines below for migration and setup.3. And for those who’d like to make substantial edits to the theme, it can be downloaded as a ZIP file to customize. Download Minimal Mistakes ThemeProTip: Be sure to remove /docs and /test if you forked or downloaded Minimal Mistakes. These folders contain documentation and test pages for the theme and you probably don’t littering up in your repo.Theme MigrationTo move over any existing content you’ll want to copy the contents of your _posts folder to the new site. Along with any pages, collections, data files, images, or other assets you may have.Next you’ll need to convert posts and pages to use the proper layouts and settings. In most cases you simply need to update _config.yml to your liking and set the correct layout in their YAML Front Matter.Front Matter defaults are your friend and I encourage you to leverage them instead of setting a layout and other global options in each post/page’s YAML Front Matter.Posts can be configured to use the single layout — with reading time, comments, social sharing links, and related posts enabled. Adding the following to _config.yml will set these defaults for all posts:defaults:  # _posts  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: posts    values:      layout: single      read_time: true      comments: true      share: true      related: truePost/Page Settings: Be sure to read through the “Working with…” documentation to learn about all the options available to you. The theme has been designed to be flexible — with numerous settings for each.Install DependenciesIf this is your first time using Jekyll be sure to read through the official documentation before jumping in. This guide assumes you have Ruby v2 installed and a basic understanding of how Jekyll works.To keep your sanity and better manage dependencies I strongly urge you to install Bundler with gem install bundler and use the following Gemfile:source \"https://rubygems.org\"# Hello! This is where you manage which Jekyll version is used to run.# When you want to use a different version, change it below, save the# file and run `bundle install`. Run Jekyll with `bundle exec`, like so:##     bundle exec jekyll serve## This will help ensure the proper Jekyll version is running.# Happy Jekylling!# gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins# To upgrade, run `bundle update`.gem \"jekyll\", \"~&gt; 3.5\"gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\"# The following plugins are automatically loaded by the theme-gem:#   gem \"jekyll-paginate\"#   gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"#   gem \"jekyll-gist\"#   gem \"jekyll-feed\"#   gem \"jemoji\"#   gem \"jekyll-data\"## If you have any other plugins, put them here!group :jekyll_plugins doendProTip: To be bleeding edge install the latest (unreleased) version of Minimal Mistakes by adding this line to your Gemfile: gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :github =&gt; \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\".To maintain a local Jekyll environment in sync with GitHub Pages replace the gem \"jekyll\" line with gem \"github-pages\", group: :jekyll_plugins and run the following:$ bundle installNote: The GitHub Pages gem installs additional dependencies that may need to be added to your Gemfile if you decide to remove the gem \"github-pages\" eg. jekyll-paginate, jekyll-sitemap, jekyll-feed, etc.  Depending on what gems you already have installed you may have to run bundle update to clear up any dependency issues. Bundler is usually pretty good at letting you know what gems need updating or have issues installing, to further investigate.When using Bundler to manage gems you’ll want to run Jekyll using bundle exec jekyll serve and bundle exec jekyll build.Doing so executes the gem versions specified in Gemfile.lock. Sure you can test your luck with a naked jekyll serve, but I wouldn’t suggest it. A lot of Jekyll errors originate from outdated or conflicting gems fighting with each other. So do yourself a favor and just use Bundler.","categories": [],

        "title": "Upgrading",
        "excerpt":"If you’re using the Ruby Gem or remote theme versions of Minimal Mistakes, upgrading is fairly painless.To check which version you are currently using, view the source of your built site and you should see something similar to:&lt;!--  Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme 4.9.0 by Michael Rose  Copyright 2013-2018 Michael Rose - mademistakes.com | @mmistakes  Free for personal and commercial use under the MIT license  https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes/blob/master/LICENSE.txt--&gt;At the top of every .html file, /assets/css/main.css, and /assets/js/main.min.js.Ruby GemSimply run bundle update if you’re using Bundler (have a Gemfile) or gem update minimal-mistakes-jekyll if you’re not.When using Bundler you can downgrade or lock the theme to a specific release (tag), branch, or commit. Instead of gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" you’d add the following to your Gemfile:gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :tag =&gt; \"4.9.0\"For more information on installing gems from git repositories consult Bundler’s documentation.Remote ThemeWhen setting remote_theme: \"mmistakes/minimal-mistakes\" in your _config.yml you may also optionally specify a branch, tag, or commit to use by appending an @ and the Git ref.For example you can roll back to release 4.8.1 with mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@4.8.1 or a specific commit with mmistakes/minimal-mistakes@bbf3cbc5fd64a3e1885f3f99eb90ba92af84063d).To update the theme on GitHub Pages you’ll need to push up a commit to force a rebuild. An empty commit works well if you don’t have anything to push at the moment:git commit --allow-empty -m \"Force rebuild of site\"Use GitIf you want to get the most out of the Jekyll + GitHub Pages workflow, then you’ll need to utilize Git. To pull down theme updates you must first ensure there’s an upstream remote. If you forked the theme’s repo then you’re likely good to go.To double check, run git remote -v and verify that you can fetch from origin https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git.To add it you can do the following:git remote add upstream https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.gitPull Down UpdatesNow you can pull any commits made to theme’s master branch with:git pull upstream masterDepending on the amount of customizations you’ve made after forking, there’s likely to be merge conflicts. Work through any conflicting files Git flags, staging the changes you wish to keep, and then commit them.Update Files ManuallyAnother way of dealing with updates is downloading the theme — replacing your layouts, includes, and assets with the newer ones manually. To be sure that you don’t miss any changes it’s probably a good idea to review the theme’s commit history to see what’s changed since.Here’s a quick checklist of the important folders/files you’ll want to be mindful of:            Name                         _layouts      Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any layouts.              _includes      Replace all. Apply edits if you customized any includes.              assets      Replace all. Apply edits if you customized stylesheets or scripts.              _sass      Replace all. Apply edits if you customized Sass partials.              _data/navigation.yml      Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions.              _data/ui-text.yml      Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions.              _config.yml      Safe to keep. Verify that there were no major structural changes or additions.      Note: If you’re not seeing the latest version, be sure to flush browser and CDN caches. Depending on your hosting environment older versions of /assets/css/main.css, /assets/js/main.min.js, or *.html may be cached.","categories": [],

        "title": "Configuration",
        "excerpt":"Settings that affect your entire site can be changed in Jekyll’s configuration file: _config.yml, found in the root of your project. If you don’t have this file you’ll need to copy or create one using the theme’s default _config.yml as a base.Note: for technical reasons, _config.yml is NOT reloaded automatically when used with jekyll serve. If you make any changes to this file, please restart the server process for them to be applied.Take a moment to look over the configuration file included with the theme. Comments have been added to provide examples and default values for most settings. Detailed explanations of each can be found below.Site SettingsThemeIf you’re using the Ruby gem version of the theme you’ll need this line to activate it:theme: minimal-mistakes-jekyllSkinEasily change the color scheme of the theme using one of the provided “skins”:minimal_mistakes_skin: \"default\" # \"air\", \"aqua\", \"contrast\", \"dark\", \"dirt\", \"neon\", \"mint\", \"plum\" \"sunrise\"Note: If you have made edits to the theme’s CSS files be sure to update /assets/css/main.scss to include @import \"minimal-mistakes/skins/default\"; // skin before the minimal-mistakes import.Air skin: air            Calm and blue.Aqua skin: aqua            Just like water.Contrast skin: contrast            Retro feel with bold blue links and inverted footer.Dark skin: dark            Inverted palette, white text on a dark background.Dirt skin: dirt            Earthy tones.Mint skin: mint            Minty fresh green.Neon skin: neon            Inverted palette, white text on a dark background.Neon skin: plum            Purple reigns supreme.Sunrise skin: sunrise            Oranges and red.Site Localesite.locale is used to declare the primary language for each web page within the site.Example: locale: \"en-US\" sets the lang attribute for the site to the United States flavor of English, while en-GB would be for the United Kingdom style of English. Country codes are optional and the shorter variation locale: \"en\" is also acceptable. To find your language and country codes check this reference table.Properly setting the locale is important for associating localized text found in the UI Text data file. An improper match will cause parts of the UI to disappear (eg. button labels, section headings, etc).Note: The theme comes with localized text in English (en, en-US, en-GB). If you change locale in _config.yml to something else, most of the UI text will go blank. Be sure to add the corresponding locale key and translated text to _data/ui-text.yml to avoid this.Site TitleThe name of your site. Is used throughout the theme in places like the site masthead and &lt;title&gt; tags.Example: title: \"My Awesome Site\"You also have the option of customizing the separation character used in SEO-friendly page titles.Example: title_separator: \"|\" would produce page titles like Sample Page | My Awesome Site.Note: Long site titles have been known to break the masthead layout. Avoid adding a long “tagline” to the title prevent this from happening eg. `My Awesome Site is the Best Because I Say So”.Site NameUsed to assign a site author. Don’t worry, you can override the site author with different ones on specific posts, pages, or collection documents.Example: name: \"Michael Rose\".ProTip: If you want to get crafty with your YAML you can use anchors to reuse values. For example foo: &amp;var \"My String\" allows you to reuse \"My String\" elsewhere in _config.yml like so… bar: *var. You’ll see a few examples of this in the provided Jekyll config.Site DescriptionFairly obvious. site.description describes the site. Used predominantly in meta descriptions for improving SEO.Example: description: \"A flexible Jekyll theme for your blog or site with a minimalist aesthetic.\"Site URLThe base hostname and protocol for your site. If you’re hosting with GitHub Pages this will be something like url: \"https://github.io.mmistakes\" or url: \"https://mademistakes.com\" if you have a custom domain name.GitHub Pages now forces https:// for new sites so be mindful of that when setting your URL to avoid mixed-content warnings.Note: Jekyll 3.3 overrides this value with url: http://localhost:4000 when running jekyll serve locally in development. If you want to avoid this behavior set JEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.Site Base URLThis little option causes all kinds of confusion in the Jekyll community. If you’re not hosting your site as a GitHub Pages Project or in a subfolder (eg: /blog), then don’t mess with it.In the case of the Minimal Mistakes demo site it’s hosted on GitHub at https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes. To correctly set this base path I’d use url: \"https://mmistakes.github.io\" and baseurl: \"/minimal-mistakes\".For more information on how to properly use site.url and site.baseurl as intended by the Jekyll maintainers, check Parker Moore’s post on the subject.Note: When using baseurl remember to include it as part of your path when testing your site locally. Values of url: and baseurl: \"/blog\" would make your local site visible at http://localhost:4000/blog and not http://localhost:4000.Site RepositoryAdd your repository name with organization to your site’s configuration file, _config.yml.repository: \"username/repo-name\"“NWO” stands for “name with owner.” It is GitHub lingo for the username of the owner of the repository plus a forward slash plus the name of the repository, e.g. mmistakes/minimal-mistakes, where mmistakes is the owner and minimal-mistakes is the repository name.Your site.github.* fields should fill in like normal. If you run Jekyll with the –verbose flag, you should be able to see all the API calls made.If you don’t set repository correctly you may see the following error when trying to serve or build your Jekyll site:Liquid Exceptions: No repo name found. Specify using PAGES_REPO_NWO environment variables, repository in your configuration, or set up origin git remote pointing to your github.com repository.For more information on how site.github data can be used with Jekyll check out github-metadata’s documentation.Site ScriptsAdd scripts to the &lt;head&gt; or closing &lt;/body&gt; elements by assigning paths to either head_scripts and/or footer_scripts.For example, to add a CDN version of jQuery to page’s head along with a custom script you’d do the following:head_scripts:  - https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.2.1.min.js  - /assets/js/your-custom-head-script.jsConsult the JavaScript documentation for more information on working with theme scripts.Site Default Teaser ImageTo assign a fallback teaser image used in the “Related Posts” module, place a graphic in the /assets/images/ directory and add the filename to _config.yml like so:teaser: /assets/images/500x300.pngThis image can be overridden at anytime by applying the following to a document’s YAML Front Matter.header:  teaser: /assets/images/my-awesome-post-teaser.jpg    Example of teaser images found in the related posts module.Breadcrumb Navigation (Beta)Enable breadcrumb links to help visitors better navigate deep sites. Because of the fragile method of implementing them they don’t always produce accurate links reliably. For best results:  Use a category based permalink structure e.g. permalink: /:categories/:title/  Manually create pages for each category or use a plugin like jekyll-archives to auto-generate them. If these pages don’t exist breadcrumb links to them will be broken.breadcrumbs: true  # disabled by defaultBreadcrumb start link text and separator character can both be changed in the UI Text data file.Reading TimeEnable estimated reading time snippets with read_time: true in YAML Front Matter. 200 has been set as the default words per minute value — which can be changed by adjusting words_per_minute: in _config.yml.Instead of adding read_time: true to each post, apply as a default in _config.yml like so:defaults:  # _posts  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: posts    values:      read_time: trueTo disable reading time for a post, add read_time: false its YAML Front Matter to override what was set in _config.yml.CommentsDisqus, Discourse, Facebook, Google+, and static-based commenting via Staticman are built into the theme. First set the comment provider you’d like to use:            Name      Comment Provider                  disqus      Disqus              discourse      Discourse              facebook      Facebook Comments              google-plus      Google+ Comments              staticman_v2      Staticman v2              staticman      Staticman v1 (deprecated)              custom      Other      Then add comments: true to each document you want comments visible on.Instead of adding YAML Front Matter to each document, apply as a default in _config.yml. To enable comments for all posts:defaults:  # _posts  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: posts    values:      comments: trueIf you add comments: false to a post’s YAML Front Matter it will override the default and disable comments for just that post.Note: Comments are disabled by default in development. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to setJEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.DisqusTo use Disqus you’ll need to create an account and shortname. Once you have both update _config.yml to:comments:  provider: \"disqus\"  disqus:    shortname: \"your-disqus-shortname\"DiscourseFor guidance on how to set up Discourse for embedding comments from a topic on a post page, consult this guide.comments:  provider               : \"discourse\"  discourse:    server               : # meta.discourse.orgNote: Do not include http:// or https:// when setting your Discourse server. The theme automatically prepends the URL //, following a scheme-less pattern.Facebook CommentsTo enable Facebook Comments choose how many comments you’d like visible per post and the color scheme of the widget.comments:  provider               : \"facebook\"  facebook:    appid                : # optional    num_posts            : # 5 (default)    colorscheme          : # \"light\" (default), \"dark\"Static-Based Comments via StaticmanTransform user comments into _data files that live inside of your GitHub repository by enabling Staticman.Note: Looking to migrate comments from a WordPress based site?

If you host your site on GitHub Pages it will likely be master unless your repo is setup as a project — use gh-pages in that case.Note: Staticman is currently only compatible with GitHub based repositories. Support for GitLab Pages is planned but not available yet.Staticman v1 (deprecated)Default settings have been provided in _config.yml.

As new comments are submitted Staticman will send a pull request. Merging these in will approve the comment, close the issue, and automatically rebuild your site (if hosted on GitHub Pages).To skip this moderation step simply set moderation: false.ProTip: Create a GitHub webhook that sends a POST request to the following payload URL https://api.staticman.net/v2/webhook and triggers a “Pull request” event to delete Staticman branches on merge.reCAPTCHA Support (v2 only)To enable Google’s reCAPTCHA to aid in spam detection you’ll need to:  Apply for reCAPTCHA API keys and register your site using the reCAPTCHA V2 type.  Add your site and secret keys to staticman.yml and _config.yml. Be sure to properly encrypt your secret key using Staticman’s encrypt endpoint.reCaptcha:  enabled: true  siteKey: # \"6LdRBykTAAAAAFB46MnIu6ixuxwu9W1ihFF8G60Q\"  secret: # \"PznnZGu3P6eTHRPLORniSq+J61YEf+A9zmColXDM5icqF49gbunH51B8+h+i2IvewpuxtA9TFoK68TuhUp/X3YKmmqhXasegHYabY50fqF9nJh9npWNhvITdkQHeaOqnFXUIwxfiEeUt49Yoa2waRR7a5LdRAP3SVM8hz0KIBT4=\"Other Comment ProvidersTo use another provider not included with the theme set provider: \"custom\" then add their embed code to _includes/comments-providers/custom.html.Custom Feed URLBy default the theme links to feed.xml generated in the root of your site by the jekyll-feed plugin. To link to an externally hosted feed update atom_feed in _config.yml like so:atom_feed:  path: \"http://feeds.feedburner.com/youFeedname\"Note: By default the site feed is linked in two locations: inside the &lt;head&gt; element and at the bottom of every page in the site footer.Site SearchTo enable site-wide search add search: true to your _config.yml.Lunr (default)The default search uses Lunr to build a search index of all your documents. This method is 100% compatible with sites hosted on GitHub Pages.Note: Only the first 50 words of a post or page’s body content is added to the Lunr search index. Setting search_full_content to true in your _config.yml will override this and could impact page load performance.AlgoliaFor faster and more relevant search (see demo):      Add the jekyll-algolia gem to your Gemfile, in the :jekyll_plugins section.    group :jekyll_plugins do  gem \"jekyll-feed\"  gem \"jekyll-seo-tag\"  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"  gem \"jekyll-algolia\"end        Once this is done, download all dependencies by running bundle install.        Switch search providers from lunr to algolia in your _config.yml file:    search_provider: algolia            Add the following Algolia credentials to your _config.yml file. If you don’t have an Algolia account, you can open a free Community plan. Once signed in, you can grab your credentials from your dashboard.    algolia:  application_id: # YOUR_APPLICATION_ID  index_name: # YOUR_INDEX_NAME  search_only_api_key: # YOUR_SEARCH_ONLY_API_KEY  powered_by: # true (default), false            Once your credentials are setup, you can run the indexing with the following command:    ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your_admin_api_key bundle exec jekyll algolia        For Windows users you will have to use set to assigned the ALGOLIA_API_KEY environment variable.    set ALGOLIA_API_KEY=your_admin_api_keybundle exec jekyll algolia        Note that ALGOLIA_API_KEY should be set to your admin API key.  To use the Algolia search with GitHub Pages hosted sites follow this deployment guide. Or this guide for deploying on Netlify.Note: The Jekyll Algolia plugin can be configured in several ways. Be sure to check out their full documentation on how to exclude files and other valuable settings.SEO, Social Sharing, and Analytics SettingsAll optional, but a good idea to take the time setting up to improve SEO and links shared from the site.Google Search ConsoleFormerly known as Google Webmaster Tools, add your verification code like so: google_site_verification: \"yourVerificationCode\".Note: You likely won’t have to do this if you verify site ownership through Google Analytics instead.Bing Webmaster ToolsThere are several ways to verify site ownership — the easiest adding an authentication code to your config file.Copy and paste the string inside of content:&lt;meta name=\"msvalidate.01\" content=\"0FC3FD70512616B052E755A56F8952D\" /&gt;Into _config.ymlbing_site_verification: \"0FC3FD70512616B052E755A56F8952D\"Naver Webmaster ToolsTo verify site ownership you will need to create a Naver account and then Add your site via Naver Webmaster Tools.Much like Google and Bing you’ll be provided with a meta description:&lt;meta name=\"naver-site-verification\" content=\"6BF5A01C0E650B479B612AC5A2184144\"&gt;`Which you can add to your _config.yml like so:naver_site_verification: \"6BF5A01C0E650B479B612AC5A2184144\"YandexTo verify site ownership copy and paste the string inside of content:&lt;meta name='yandex-verification' content='2132801JL' /&gt;Into _config.ymlyandex_site_verification: \"2132801JL\"Twitter Cards and Facebook Open GraphTo improve the appearance of links shared from your site to social networks like Twitter and Facebook be sure to configure the following.Site Twitter UsernameTwitter username for the site. For pages that have custom author Twitter accounts assigned in their YAML Front Matter or data file, they will be attributed as a creator in the Twitter Card.For example if my site’s Twitter account is @mmistakes-theme I would add the following to _config.ymltwitter:  username: \"mmistakes-theme\"And if I assign @mmistakes as an author account it will appear in the Twitter Card along with @mmistakes-theme, attributed as a creator of the page being shared.Note: You need to apply for Twitter Cards and validate they’re working on your site before they will begin showing up.Facebook Open GraphIf you have a Facebook ID or publisher page add them:facebook:  app_id:  # A Facebook app ID  publisher:  # A Facebook page URL or ID of the publishing entityWhile not part a part of Open Graph, you can also add your Facebook username for use in the sidebar and footer.facebook:  username: \"michaelrose\"  # https://www.facebook.com/michaelroseProTip: To debug Open Graph data use this tool to test your pages. If content changes aren’t reflected you will probably have to hit the Fetch new scrape information button to refresh.Open Graph Default ImageFor pages that don’t have a header.image assigned in their YAML Front Matter, site.og_image will be used as a fallback. Use your logo, icon, avatar or something else that is meaningful. Just make sure it is place in the /assets/images/ folder, a minimum size of 120px by 120px, and less than 1MB in file size.og_image: /assets/images/site-logo.png    Example of a image placed in a Summary Card.Documents who have a header.image assigned in their YAML Front Matter will appear like this when shared on Twitter and Facebook.    Shared page on Twitter with header image assigned.    Shared page on Facebook with header image assigned.Include your social profile in search resultsUse markup on your official website to add your social profile information to the Google Knowledge panel in some searches. Knowledge panels can prominently display your social profile information.social:  type:  # Person or Organization (defaults to Person)  name:  # If the user or organization name differs from the site's name  links:    - \"https://twitter.com/yourTwitter\"    - \"https://facebook.com/yourFacebook\"    - \"https://instagram.com/yourProfile\"    - \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/yourprofile\"    - \"https://plus.google.com/your_profile\"AnalyticsAnalytics is disabled by default. To enable globally select one of the following:            Name      Analytics Provider                  google      Google Standard Analytics              google-universal      Google Universal Analytics              google-gtag      Google Analytics Global Site Tag)              custom      Other analytics providers      For Google Analytics add your Tracking Code:analytics:  provider: \"google-gtag\"  google:    tracking_id: \"UA-1234567-8\"To use another provider not included with the theme set provider: \"custom\" then add their embed code to _includes/analytics-providers/custom.html.Note: Analytics are disabled by default in development. To enable when testing/building locally be sure to setJEKYLL_ENV=production to force the environment to production.Site AuthorUsed as the defaults for defining what appears in the author sidebar.Note: For sites with multiple authors these values can be overridden post by post with custom YAML Front Matter and a data file. For more information on how that works see below.author:  name   : \"Your Name\"  avatar : \"/assets/images/bio-photo.jpg\"  bio    : \"My awesome biography constrained to a sentence or two goes here.\"  email  : # optional  uri    : \"http://your-site.com\"  home   : # null (default), \"absolute or relative url to link to author home\"Social media links are all optional, include the ones you want visible. In most cases you just need to add the username. If you’re unsure double check _includes/author-profile.html to see how the URL is constructed.To add social media links not included with the theme or customize the author sidebar further, read the full layout documentation.Reading FilesNothing out of the ordinary here. include and exclude may be the only things you need to alter.Conversion and Markdown ProcessingAgain nothing out of the ordinary here as the theme adheres to the defaults used by GitHub Pages. Kramdown for Markdown conversion, Rouge syntax highlighting, and incremental building disabled. Change them if you need to.Front Matter DefaultsTo save yourself time setting Front Matter Defaults for posts, pages, and collections is the way to go. Sure you can assign layouts and toggle settings like reading time, comments, and social sharing in each file, but that’s not ideal.Using the default key in _config.yml you could set the layout and enable author profiles, reading time, comments, social sharing, and related posts for all posts — in one shot.defaults:  # _posts  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: posts    values:      layout: single      author_profile: true      read_time: true      comments: true      share: true      related: truePages Front Matter defaults can be scoped like this:defaults:  # _pages  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: pages    values:      layout: singleAnd collections like this:defaults:  # _foo  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: foo    values:      layout: singleAnd of course any default value can be overridden by settings in a post, page, or collection file. All you need to do is specify the settings in the YAML Front Matter. For more examples be sure to check out the demo site’s _config.yml.OutputtingThe default permalink style used by the theme is permalink: /:categories/:title/. If you have a post named 2016-01-01-my-post.md with categories: foo in the YAML Front Matter, Jekyll will generate _site/foo/my-post/index.html.Note: If you plan on enabling breadcrumb links — including category names in permalinks is a big part of how those are created.PaginateIf using pagination on the homepage you can change the amount of posts shown with:paginate: 5You’ll also need to include some Liquid and HTML to properly use the paginator, which you can find in the Layouts section under Home Page.The paginator only works on files with name index.html. To use pagination in a subfolder — for example /recent/, create /recent/index.html and set the paginate_path in _config.yml to this:paginate_path: /recent/page:num/Please note: When using Jekyll’s default pagination plugin paginator.posts can only be called once. If you’re looking for something more powerful that can paginate category, tag, and collection pages I suggest jekyll-paginate-v2.TimezoneThis sets the timezone environment variable, which Ruby uses to handle time and date creation and manipulation. Any entry from the IANA Time Zone Database is valid. The default is the local time zone, as set by your operating system.timezone: America/New_YorkPluginsWhen hosting with GitHub Pages a small set of gems have been whitelisted for use. The theme uses a few of them which can be found under gems. Additional settings and configurations are documented in the links below.            Plugin      Description                  jekyll-paginate      Pagination Generator for Jekyll.              jekyll-sitemap      Jekyll plugin to silently generate a sitemaps.org compliant sitemap for your Jekyll site.              jekyll-gist      Liquid tag for displaying GitHub Gists in Jekyll sites.              jekyll-feed      A Jekyll plugin to generate an Atom (RSS-like) feed of your Jekyll posts.              jemoji      GitHub-flavored emoji plugin for Jekyll.      If you’re hosting elsewhere then you don’t really have to worry about what is whitelisted as you are free to include whatever Jekyll plugins you desire.Archive SettingsThe theme ships with support for taxonomy (category and tag) pages. GitHub Pages hosted sites need to use a Liquid only approach while those hosted elsewhere can use plugins like jekyll-archives to generate these pages automatically.The default type is set to use Liquid.Note: category_archive and tag_archive were previously named categories and tags. Names were changed to avoid possible conflicts with site.categories and site.tags.category_archive:  type: liquid  path: /categories/tag_archive:  type: liquid  path: /tags/Which would create category and tag links in the breadcrumbs and page meta like: /categories/#foo and /tags/#foo.Note: these are simply hash (fragment) links into the full taxonomy index pages. For them to resolve properly, the category and tag index pages need to exist at /categories/index.html (copy to _pages/category-archive.html) and /tags/index.html (copy to _pages/tag-archive.html).If you have the luxury of using Jekyll Plugins, then jekyll-archives will create a better experience as discrete taxonomy pages would be generated, and their corresponding links would be “real” (not just hash/fragment links into a larger index). However, the plugin will not generate the taxonomy index pages (category-archive.html and _pages/tag-archive.html) so you’d still need to manually create them if you’d like to have them (see note above).First, you’ll need to make sure that the jekyll-archives plugin is installed. Either run gem install jekyll-archives or add the following to your Gemfile:group :jekyll_plugins do  gem \"jekyll-archives\"endThen run bundle install.Now that the plugin is installed, change type to jekyll-archives and apply the following configurations:category_archive:  type: jekyll-archives  path: /categories/tag_archive:  type: jekyll-archives  path: /tags/jekyll-archives:  enabled:    - categories    - tags  layouts:    category: archive-taxonomy    tag: archive-taxonomy  permalinks:    category: /categories/:name/    tag: /tags/:name/Note: The archive-taxonomy layout used by jekyll-archives is provided with the theme and can be found in the _layouts folder.HTML CompressionIf you care at all about performance (and really who doesn’t) compressing the HTML files generated by Jekyll is a good thing to do.If you’re hosting with GitHub Pages there aren’t many options afforded to you for optimizing the HTML Jekyll generates. Thankfully there is some Liquid wizardry you can use to strip whitespace and comments to reduce file size.There’s a variety of configurations and caveats to using the compress layout, so be sure to read through the documentation if you decide to make change the defaults set in the theme’s _config.yml.compress_html:  clippings: all  ignore:    envs: development  # disable compression in dev environmentCaution: Inline JavaScript comments can cause problems with compress.html, so be sure to /* comment this way */ and avoid // these sorts of comments.Note: CDN services such as CloudFlare provide optional automatic minification for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. If you are serving your site via such a service and have minification enabled, this configuration might be redundant.","categories": [],

Meaning they’re not easily visible in your project.Each of these files can be modified, but you’ll need to copy the default version into your project first. For example, if you wanted to modify the default single layout, you’d start by copying it to _layouts/single.html.ProTip: To locate theme files, run bundle show minimal-mistakes-jekyll. Then copy the files you want to override from the returned path, to the appropriate folder in your project.Jekyll will use the files in your project first before falling back to the default versions of the theme. It exhibits this behavior with files in the following folders:/assets/_layouts/_includes/_sassAdditionally, from v4.5.0 the theme-gem will also exhibit above behavior for /_data via a plugin.Consequently, the data files for UI Text and Navigation are also bundled within the theme-gem.For more information on customizing the theme’s stylesheets and JavaScript, see the appropriate pages.","categories": [],

This description will show up like a tooltip, when the user hovers over the link on a desktop browser.ProTip: Put the most important links first so they’re always visible and not hidden behind the menu toggle.Breadcrumbs (Beta)Enable breadcrumb links to help visitors better navigate deep sites. Because of the fragile method of implementing them they don’t always produce accurate links reliably. For best results:  Use a category based permalink structure e.g. permalink: /:categories/:title/  Manually create pages for each category or use a plugin like jekyll-archives to auto-generate them.

Below you’ll find the layouts included with Minimal Mistakes, what they look like and the type of content they’ve been built for.Default LayoutThe base layout all other layouts inherit from. There’s not much to this layout apart from pulling in several _includes:  &lt;head&gt; elements  masthead navigation links  {{ content }}  page footer  scriptsNote: You won’t ever assign this layout directly to a post or page. Instead all other layouts will build off of it by setting layout: default in their YAML Front Matter.Layout Based and User-Defined ClassesClass names corresponding to each layout are automatically added to the &lt;body&gt; element eg. &lt;body class=\"layout--single\"&gt;.            layout      class name                  archive      .layout--archive              archive-taxonomy      .layout--archive-taxonomy              search      .layout--search              single      .layout--single              splash      .layout--splash              home      .layout--home      Using YAML Front Matter you can also assign custom classes to target with CSS or JavaScript.

Add the following to a post or page’s YAML Front Matter:classes: wideNote: If the page contains a table of contents, it will no longer appear to the right. Instead it will be forced into the main content container directly following the page’s title.Table of ContentsAuto-generated table of contents list for your posts and pages can be enabled by adding toc: true to the YAML Front Matter.

To override this text with something more specific use the following YAML Front Matter:excerpt: \"A unique line of text to describe this post that will display in an archive listing and meta description with SEO benefits.\"Grid ViewAdding type=grid to the archive-single helper will display archive posts in a 4 column grid. For example to create an archive displaying all documents in the portfolio collection:Step 1: Create a portfolio archive page (eg. _pages/portfolio-archive.html) with the following YAML Front Matter:---layout: archivetitle: \"Portfolio\"permalink: /portfolio/author_profile: false---Step 2: Loop over all documents in the portfolio collection and output in a grid:&lt;div class=\"grid__wrapper\"&gt;  {% for post in site.portfolio %}    {% include archive-single.html type=\"grid\" %}  {% endfor %}&lt;/div&gt;To produce something like this:    Grid view example.Teaser images are assigned similar to header images using the following YAML Front Matter:header:  teaser: path-to-teaser-image.jpgNote: More information on using this _include can be found under Helpers.Taxonomy ArchiveIf you have the luxury of using Jekyll plugins, the creation of category and tag archives is greatly simplified. Simply enable support for the jekyll-archives plugin with a few _config.yml settings as noted in the Configuration section and you’re good to go.If you’re not using the jekyll-archives plugin then you need to create archive pages yourself. Sample taxonomy archives can be found by grabbing the HTML sources below and adding to your site.            Name      HTML Source                  Categories Archive      category-archive.html              Tags Archive      tag-archive.html      The Tags Archive page that responds to urls such as /tags/#tips looks something like this:---layout: archivepermalink: /tags/title: \"Posts by Tag\"author_profile: true---{% include group-by-array collection=site.posts field=\"tags\" %}{% for tag in group_names %}  {% assign posts = group_items[forloop.index0] %}  &lt;h2 id=\"{{ tag | slugify }}\" class=\"archive__subtitle\"&gt;{{ tag }}&lt;/h2&gt;  {% for post in posts %}    {% include archive-single.html %}  {% endfor %}{% endfor %}Home Page LayoutA derivative archive page layout to be used as a simple home page. It is built to show a paginated list of recent posts based off of the pagination settings in _config.yml.    Example of a paginated home page showing 5 recent posts.To use create index.html at the root of your project and add the following YAML Front Matter:---layout: home---Then configure pagination in _config.yml.paginate: 5 # amount of posts to showpaginate_path: /page:num/If you’d rather have a paginated page of posts reside in a subfolder instead of acting as your homepage make the following adjustments.Create index.html in the location you’d like. For example if I wanted it to live at /blog I’d create /blog/index.html with layout: home in its YAML Front Matter.Then adjust the paginate_path in _config.yml to match.paginate_path: /blog/page:numNote: Jekyll can only paginate a single index.html file. If you’d like to paginate more pages (e.g. category indexes) you’ll need the help of a custom plugin. For more pagination related settings check the Configuration section.Splash Page LayoutFor full-width landing pages that need a little something extra add layout: splash to the YAML Front Matter.Includes:  Optional header image with caption  Optional header overlay (solid color/image) + text and optional “call to action” button  Feature blocks (left, center, and right alignment options)Feature blocks can be assigned and aligned to the left, right, or center with a sprinkling of YAML. For full details on how to use the feature_row helper check the Content section or review a sample splash page.Search Page LayoutA page with a search form. Add layout: search to the YAML Front Matter similar to this example on the demo site.Note: A page using the layout: search isn’t compatible with the new site search feature incorporated in the masthead.ExclusionsIf you would like to exclude specific pages/posts from the search index set the search flag to false in the YAML Front Matter for the page/post.search: falseProTip: Add a link to this page in the masthead navigation.HeadersTo add some visual punch to a post or page, a large full-width header image can be included.Be sure to resize your header images. ~1280px is a good width if you aren’t responsively serving up images. Through the magic of CSS they will scale up or down to fill the container. If you go with something too small it will look like garbage when upscaled, and something too large will hurt performance.Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: /assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now /assets/images/, but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This all applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml as well.Place your images in the /assets/images/ folder and add the following YAML Front Matter:header:  image: /assets/images/image-filename.jpgFor externally hosted images include the full image path instead of just the filename:header:  image: http://some-site.com/assets/images/image.jpgTo provide a custom alt tag for screen readers:header:  image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg  image_description: \"A description of the image\"To include a caption or attribution for the image:header:  image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg  caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"ProTip: Captions written in Markdown are supported, so feel free to add links, or style text. Just be sure to wrap it in quotes.Header OverlayTo overlay text on top of a header image you have a few more options:            Name      Description      Default                  overlay_image      Header image you’d like to overlay. Same rules as header.image from above.                     overlay_filter      Color/opacity to overlay on top of the header image eg: 0.5 or rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5).                     show_overlay_excerpt      Display excerpt in the overlay text      true              excerpt      Auto-generated page excerpt is added to the overlay text or can be overridden.                     cta_label      Call to action button text label.      more_label in UI Text data file              cta_url      Call to action button URL.             With this YAML Front Matter:excerpt: \"This post should display a **header with an overlay image**, if the theme supports it.\"header:  overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg  caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"  cta_label: \"More Info\"  cta_url: \"https://unsplash.com\"You’d get a header image overlaid with text and a call to action button like this:You also have the option of specifying a solid background-color to use instead of an image.excerpt: \"This post should display a **header with a solid background color**, if the theme supports it.\"header:  overlay_color: \"#333\"You can also specifying the opacity (between 0 and 1) of a black overlay like so:excerpt: \"This post should [...]\"header:  overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg  overlay_filter: 0.5 # same as adding an opacity of 0.5 to a black background  caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"  cta_label: \"More Info\"  cta_url: \"https://unsplash.com\"Or if you want to do more fancy things, go full rgba:excerpt: \"This post should [...]\"header:  overlay_image: /assets/images/unsplash-image-1.jpg  overlay_filter: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)  caption: \"Photo credit: [**Unsplash**](https://unsplash.com)\"  cta_label: \"More Info\"  cta_url: \"https://unsplash.com\"OpenGraph &amp; Twitter Card ImagesBy default the large page header or overlay images are used for sharing previews. If you’d like to set this image to something else use page.header.og_image like:header:  image: /assets/images/your-page-image.jpg  og_image: /assets/images/your-og-image.jpgProTip: og_image is useful for setting OpenGraph images on pages that don’t have a header or overlay image.SidebarsThe space to the left of a page’s main content is blank by default, but has the ability to show an author profile (name, short biography, social media links), custom content, or both.Author ProfileAdd author_profile: true to a post or page’s YAML Front Matter.Better yet, enable it with Front Matter Defaults set in _config.yml.defaults:  # _posts  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: posts    values:      author_profile: trueNote: To disable the author sidebar profile for a specific post or page, add author_profile: false to the YAML Front Matter instead.The theme comes pre-built with a selection of links for the most common social media networks. These are all optional and can be assigned in _config.yml.To add more links you’ll need to crack open _includes/author-profile-custom-links.html and add the appropriate &lt;li&gt; markup shown below.Please note: Links added here will appear after the ones in _includes/author-profile.html. If you’d like to change the order of appearance you’ll need to edit that file directly.Social network link example&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://whatever-social-network.com/username\"&gt;    &lt;i class=\"fab fa-fw\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Awesome Social Network  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;To add a new link you’ll need three things:  Destination URL  Font Awesome icon (fa- class)  Label for the linkIt’s up to you if you want to wrap it in a {% if %} ... {% endif %}conditional and add a variable to _config.yml. If you don’t plan to change it then hard-coding the string is perfectly acceptable.Let’s run through how you’d add a new link that points to a Reddit profile. Starting with the three things from above:  https://www.reddit.com/user/username  fa-reddit  RedditAnd plug them into the appropriate locations:&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=\"[1]\"&gt;    &lt;i class=\"fab fa-fw [2]\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; [3]  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;To end up with:&lt;li&gt;  &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/user/username\"&gt;    &lt;i class=\"fab fa-fw fa-reddit\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Reddit  &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;To add a touch of color to the default black (#000) icon a few more steps are necessary.Start by copying _utilities.scss &lt;site root&gt;/_sass. Open it up to the icon section (it’s near the bottom) and nest a new class beneath .social-icons that matches the one used to declare the Font Awesome icon. In our case .fa-reddit.Simply add a color declaration and the corresponding hex code..social-icons {    .fa-reddit {    color: #ff4500;  }}ProTip: For bonus points you can add it as a Sass $variable that you set in _variables.scss like the other “brand” colors. You’ll need to add this file to /_sass/ as well if you’re using the Ruby Gem version of the theme.Please please please don’t submit pull requests adding in support for “missing” social media links. I’m trying to keep things down to the minimum (hence the theme’s name) and have no interest in merging such PRs :expressionless:.Custom Sidebar ContentBlocks of content can be added by using the following under sidebar:            Name      Description                  title      Title or heading.              image      Image path placed in /images/ folder or an external URL.              image_alt      Alternate description for image.              text      Text. Markdown is allowed.      Multiple blocks can also be added by following the example below:sidebar:  - title: \"Title\"    image: http://placehold.it/350x250    image_alt: \"image\"    text: \"Some text here.\"  - title: \"Another Title\"    text: \"More text here.\"    Example of custom sidebar content added as YAML Front Matter.Note: Custom sidebar content added to a post or page’s YAML Front Matter will appear below the author profile if enabled with author_profile: true.Custom Sidebar Navigation MenuTo create a sidebar menu1 similar to the one found in the theme’s documentation pages you’ll need to modify a _data file and some YAML Front Matter.    Custom sidebar navigation menu example.To start, add a new key to _data/navigation.yml. This will be referenced later in via YAML Front Matter so keep it short and memorable. In the case of the theme’s documentation menu I used docs.Sample sidebar menu links:docs:  - title: Getting Started    children:      - title: \"Quick-Start Guide\"        url: /docs/quick-start-guide/      - title: \"Structure\"        url: /docs/structure/      - title: \"Installation\"        url: /docs/installation/      - title: \"Upgrading\"        url: /docs/upgrading/  - title: Customization    children:      - title: \"Configuration\"        url: /docs/configuration/      - title: \"Navigation\"        url: /docs/navigation/      - title: \"UI Text\"        url: /docs/ui-text/      - title: \"Authors\"        url: /docs/authors/      - title: \"Layouts\"        url: /docs/layouts/  - title: Content    children:      - title: \"Working with Posts\"        url: /docs/posts/      - title: \"Working with Pages\"        url: /docs/pages/      - title: \"Working with Collections\"        url: /docs/collections/      - title: \"Helpers\"        url: /docs/helpers/      - title: \"Utility Classes\"        url: /docs/utility-classes/  - title: Extras    children:      - title: \"Stylesheets\"        url: /docs/stylesheets/      - title: \"JavaScript\"        url: /docs/javascript/Now you can pull these links into any page by adding the following YAML Front Matter.sidebar:  nav: \"docs\"Note: nav: \"docs\" references the docs key in _data/navigation.yml so make sure they match.If you’re adding a sidebar navigation menu to several pages the use of Front Matter Defaults is a better option. You can define them in _config.yml to avoid adding it to every page or post.Sample sidebar nav default:defaults:  # _docs  - scope:      path: \"\"      type: docs    values:      sidebar:        nav: \"docs\"Social Sharing LinksThe single layout has an option to enable social links at the bottom of posts for sharing on Twitter, Facebook, Google+, and LinkedIn. Similar to the links found in the author sidebar, the theme ships with defaults for the most common social networks.To enable these links add share: true to a post or page’s YAML Front Matter or use a default in your _config.yml to apply more globally.If you’d like to add, remove, or change the order of these default links you can do so by editing _includes/social-share.html.Let’s say you wanted to replace the Google+ button with a Reddit one. Simply replace the HTML with the following:&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url={{ page.url | absolute_url }}&amp;title={{ page.title }}\" class=\"btn\" title=\"{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].share_on_label }} Reddit\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fab fa-fw fa-reddit\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The important parts to change are:  Share point URL *eg. https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=  Link title  Font Awesome icon (fa- class)  Link labelTo change the color of the button use one of the built in utility classes. Or you can create a new button class to match whatever color you want.Under the $social color map in assets/_scss/_buttons.scss simply add a name (this will be appened to btn--) that matches the new button class. In our case reddit ~&gt; .btn--reddit.$social:(facebook, $facebook-color),(twitter, $twitter-color),(google-plus, $google-plus-color),(linkedin, $linkedin-color);(reddit, #ff4500;)ProTip: For bonus points you can add it as a Sass $variable that you set in _variables.scss like the other “brand” colors.Add the new .btn--reddit class to the &lt;a&gt; element from earlier, compile main.css and away you go.&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/submit?url={{ page.url | absolute_url }}&amp;title={{ page.title }}\" class=\"btn btn--reddit\" title=\"{{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].share_on_label }} Reddit\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"fab fa-fw fa-reddit\" aria-hidden=\"true\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span&gt; Reddit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;            Sidebar menu supports 1 level of nested links. &#8617;      ","categories": [],

Instead the theme leverages includes to do something similar.Base PathDeprecated.

Simply add {% include base_path %} to layouts, posts, pages, collections, or other includes and you’re good to go.ProTip: It’s a good practice to use absolute URL paths for assets (especially post images) so they correctly resolve in the site’s XML feeds.

It is encouraged that you migrate to the YAML Front Matter method above.            Parameter      Required      Description      Default                  title      Optional      Table of contents title.

Other FA icons can be used instead.      TOC example with custom title and icon{% include toc icon=\"cog\" title=\"My Table of Contents\" %}Navigation ListInclude an unordered list of links to be used as sidebar navigation with the nav_list helper.1. Start by adding a set of titles and URLs to _data/navigation.yml in the same way the main navigation is built.foo navigation example:# _data/navigation.ymlfoo:  - title: \"Link 1 Title\"    url: /link-1-page-url/  - title: \"Link 2 Title\"    url: http://external-link.com  - title: \"Link 3 Title\"    url: /link-3-page-url/  - title: \"Link 4 Title\"    url: /link-4-page-url/For a navigation list that has child pages you’d structure the YAML like this:# _data/navigation.ymlfoo:  - title: \"Parent Link 1\"    url: /parent-1-page-url/    children:      - title: \"Child Link 1\"        url: /child-1-page-url/      - title: \"Child Link 2\"        url: /child-2-page-url/  - title: \"Parent Link 2\"    url: /parent-2-page-url/    children:      - title: \"Child Link 1\"        url: /child-1-page-url/      - title: \"Child Link 2\"        url: /child-2-page-url/      - title: \"Child Link 3\"        url: /child-3-page-url/2: On the page(s) you’d like the foo sidebar nav add the following YAML Front Matter, referencing the same key name.sidebar:  nav: \"foo\"ProTip: If you’re applying the same navigation list to several pages setting it as a Front Matter default is the better option.The theme’s documentation is built with the nav_list helper so if you’d like an example to dissect take a look at navigation.yml, _config.yml and _doc collection in the /docs/ folder of this repo.To add a navigation list to a post or page’s main content instead of the sidebar use the include this way:{% include nav_list nav=\"foo\" %}      Toggle Menu                                                  Parent Link 1                                                                                              Child Link 1                                                                      Child Link 2                                                                                Parent Link 2                                                                                              Child Link 1                                                                      Child Link 2                                                                      Child Link 3                                                  Parameter      Required      Description                  items      Required      Name of the links array found in _data/navigation.yml.

Copy the contents of /assets/css/main.scss from there to &lt;your_project&gt;.      Customize what you want inside &lt;your_project&gt;/assets/css/main.scss.            Copy from this repo.          Copy the contents of assets/css/main.scss to &lt;your_project&gt;.      Customize what you want inside &lt;your_project/assets/css/main.scss.      Note: To make more extensive changes and customize the Sass partials bundled in the gem. You will need to copy the complete contents of the _sass directory to &lt;your_project&gt; due to the way Jekyll currently reads those files.To make basic tweaks to theme’s style Sass variables can be overridden by adding to &lt;your_project&gt;/assets/css/main.scss. For instance, to change the link color used throughout the theme add:$link-color: red;Before any @import lines.Paragraph IndentionTo mimic the look of type set in a printed book or manuscript you may want to enable paragraph indention. When $paragraph-indent is set to true indents are added to each sibling and the margin below each paragraph is removed.    Example of indented paragraphs.The size of the indent can also be customized by changing the value of $indent-var.Font StacksBy default the theme uses system fonts for all of the font stacks (serif, sans-serif, and monospace). This is done in part to provide a clean base for you to build off of and to improve performance since we aren’t loading any custom webfonts by default./* system typefaces */$serif      : Georgia, Times, serif;$sans-serif : -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Roboto\", \"Segoe UI\", \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Lucida Grande\", Arial, sans-serif;$monospace  : Monaco, Consolas, \"Lucida Console\", monospace;Sans-serif fonts have been used for most of the type, with serifs reserved for captions. If you wish to change this you’ll need to poke around the various SCSS partials and modify font-family declarations.ProTip: To use webfonts from services like Adobe TypeKit or Google Fonts simply update the font stacks and then add their scripts to _includes/head/custom.html.Typography from Older VersionsNot a fan of the refreshed typography of the theme and want to revert back an older version? Easy enough.1. Add this Google Fonts script to _includes/head/custom.html:&lt;link href=\"https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=PT+Sans+Narrow:400,700|PT+Serif:400,700,400italic\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"&gt;2. Update the following SCSS variables:$serif              : \"PT Serif\", Georgia, Times, serif;$sans-serif-narrow  : \"PT Sans Narrow\", -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, \"Roboto\", \"Segoe UI\", \"Helvetica Neue\", \"Lucida Grande\", Arial, sans-serif;$global-font-family : $serif;$header-font-family : $sans-serif-narrow;Type ScaleWherever possible type scale variables have been used instead of writing out fixed sizes. This makes updating much easier by changing values in one file.Example:.page__lead {  font-family: $global-font-family;  font-size: $type-size-4;}Type sizes are set in ems to proportional scale as the screen size changes. Large headlines that look great on desktop monitors will shrink ever so slightly as to not be too big on mobile devices. To adjust this hierarchy simply edit the default values:/* type scale */$type-size-1 : 2.441em;  // ~39.056px$type-size-2 : 1.953em;  // ~31.248px$type-size-3 : 1.563em;  // ~25.008px$type-size-4 : 1.25em;   // ~20px$type-size-5 : 1em;      // ~16px$type-size-6 : 0.75em;   // ~12px$type-size-7 : 0.6875em; // ~11px$type-size-8 : 0.625em;  // ~10pxColorsChange the mood of your site by altering a few color variables. $body-color, $background-color, $text-color, $link-color, and $masthead-link-color will have the most affect when changed.Syntax HighlightingTo make customizing the colors used in code highlighted blocks, a base of sixteen colors (Base16) have been used.Code block colors can easily be changed by overriding any of the following color variables:Default/* default syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #263238;$base01: #2e3c43;$base02: #314549;$base03: #546e7a;$base04: #b2ccd6;$base05: #eeffff;$base06: #eeffff;$base07: #ffffff;$base08: #f07178;$base09: #f78c6c;$base0a: #ffcb6b;$base0b: #c3e88d;$base0c: #89ddff;$base0d: #82aaff;$base0e: #c792ea;$base0f: #ff5370;Solarized Light/* solarized light syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #fafafa !default;$base01: #073642 !default;$base02: #586e75 !default;$base03: #657b83 !default;$base04: #839496 !default;$base05: #586e75 !default;$base06: #eee8d5 !default;$base07: #fdf6e3 !default;$base08: #dc322f !default;$base09: #cb4b16 !default;$base0a: #b58900 !default;$base0b: #859900 !default;$base0c: #2aa198 !default;$base0d: #268bd2 !default;$base0e: #6c71c4 !default;$base0f: #d33682 !default;Contrast/* contrast syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #000000;$base01: #242422;$base02: #484844;$base03: #6c6c66;$base04: #918f88;$base05: #b5b3aa;$base06: #d9d7cc;$base07: #fdfbee;$base08: #ff6c60;$base09: #e9c062;$base0a: #ffffb6;$base0b: #a8ff60;$base0c: #c6c5fe;$base0d: #96cbfe;$base0e: #ff73fd;$base0f: #b18a3d;Dark/* dark syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #ffffff;$base01: #e0e0e0;$base02: #d0d0d0;$base03: #b0b0b0;$base04: #000000;$base05: #101010;$base06: #151515;$base07: #202020;$base08: #ff0086;$base09: #fd8900;$base0a: #aba800;$base0b: #00c918;$base0c: #1faaaa;$base0d: #3777e6;$base0e: #ad00a1;$base0f: #cc6633;Dirt/* dirt syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #231e18;$base01: #302b25;$base02: #48413a;$base03: #9d8b70;$base04: #b4a490;$base05: #cabcb1;$base06: #d7c8bc;$base07: #e4d4c8;$base08: #d35c5c;$base09: #ca7f32;$base0a: #e0ac16;$base0b: #b7ba53;$base0c: #6eb958;$base0d: #88a4d3;$base0e: #bb90e2;$base0f: #b49368;Neon/* neon syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #ffffff;$base01: #e0e0e0;$base02: #d0d0d0;$base03: #b0b0b0;$base04: #000000;$base05: #101010;$base06: #151515;$base07: #202020;$base08: #ff0086;$base09: #fd8900;$base0a: #aba800;$base0b: #00c918;$base0c: #1faaaa;$base0d: #3777e6;$base0e: #ad00a1;$base0f: #cc6633;Plum/* plum syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #ffffff;$base01: #e0e0e0;$base02: #d0d0d0;$base03: #b0b0b0;$base04: #000000;$base05: #101010;$base06: #151515;$base07: #202020;$base08: #ff0086;$base09: #fd8900;$base0a: #aba800;$base0b: #00c918;$base0c: #1faaaa;$base0d: #3777e6;$base0e: #ad00a1;$base0f: #cc6633;Sunrise/* sunrise syntax highlighting (base16) */$base00: #1d1f21;$base01: #282a2e;$base02: #373b41;$base03: #969896;$base04: #b4b7b4;$base05: #c5c8c6;$base06: #e0e0e0;$base07: #ffffff;$base08: #cc6666;$base09: #de935f;$base0a: #f0c674;$base0b: #b5bd68;$base0c: #8abeb7;$base0d: #81a2be;$base0e: #b294bb;$base0f: #a3685a;Breakpoints and Grid StuffProbably won’t need to touch these, but they’re there if you need to. Width variables are used with the @include breakpoint() mixin to adapt the design of certain elements.And $susy is used for setting the grid the theme uses. Uncommenting the lines under debug can be useful if you want to show the columns when adjusting the layout.    Susy grid debug overlay enabled.Disabling AnimationsYou can disable either the fade-in intro animation, element transition animations, or both by overriding the corresponding variables. For example if you wanted to disable all animations you could include the following lines:$intro-transition  : none;$global-transition : none;","categories": [],

See below for more details.If you add additional scripts to assets/js/plugins/ and would like them concatenated with the others, be sure to update the uglify script in package.json. Same goes for scripts that you remove.You can also add scripts to the &lt;head&gt; or closing &lt;/body&gt; elements by adding paths to following arrays in _config.yml.Example:head_scripts:  - https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js  - /assets/js/your-custom-head-script.jsfooter_scripts:  - /assets/js/your-custom-footer-script.jsNote: If you assign footer_scripts the theme’s /assets/js/main.min.js file will be deactivated. This script includes jQuery and various other plugins that you’ll need to find replacements for and include separately.Build ProcessIn an effort to reduce dependencies a set of npm scripts are used to build main.min.js instead of task runners like Gulp or Grunt. If those tools are more your style then by all means use them instead :wink:.To get started:  Install Node.js.  cd to the root of your project.  Install all of the dependencies by running npm install.Note: If you upgraded from a previous version of the theme be sure you copied over package.json prior to running npm install.If all goes well, running npm run build:js will compress/concatenate _main.js and all plugin scripts into main.min.js.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"InstallationMinimal Mistakes now requires Jekyll 3.0. Make sure to run bundle update if you aren’t on the latest version to update all gem dependencies.If you are creating a new Jekyll site using Minimal Mistakes follow these steps:  Fork the Minimal Mistakes repo.  Clone the repo you just forked and rename it.  Install Bundler gem install bundler and Run bundle install to install all dependencies (Jekyll, Jekyll-Sitemap, Octopress, etc)  Update config.yml, add navigation, and replace demo posts and pages with your own. Full details below.If you want to use Minimal Mistakes with an existing Jekyll site follow these steps:  Download Minimal Mistakes and unzip.  Rename minimal-mistakes-master to something meaningful ie: new-site  Run bundle install to install all dependencies (Jekyll, Jekyll-Sitemap, Octopress, etc)  Remove demo posts/pages and replace with your own posts, pages, and any other content you want to move over.  Update posts’ and pages’ YAML to match variables used by Minimal Mistakes. Full details below.  Update _config.yml and add navigation links. Full details below.Pro-tip: Delete the gh-pages branch after cloning and start fresh by branching off master. There is a bunch of garbage in gh-pages used for the theme’s demo site that I’m guessing you won’t want.Running JekyllThe preferred method for running Jekyll is with bundle exec, but if you’re willing to deal gem conflicts feel free to go cowboy with a jekyll serve or jekyll build.  In some cases, running executables without bundle exec may work, if the executable happens to be installed in your system and does not pull in any gems that conflict with your bundle.  However, this is unreliable and is the source of considerable pain. Even if it looks like it works, it may not work in the future or on another machine.bundle exec jekyll serveScaffoldingHow Minimal Mistakes is organized and what the various files are. All posts, layouts, includes, stylesheets, assets, and whatever else is grouped nicely under the root folder.

Open it up and personalize it. Most variables are self explanatory but here’s an explanation of each if needed:titleThe title of your site… shocker!Example title: My Awesome SiteurlUsed to generate absolute urls in sitemap.xml, feed.xml, and for generating canonical URLs in &lt;head&gt;. When developing locally either comment this out or use something like http://localhost:4000 so all assets load properly. Don’t include a trailing /.Examples:url: http://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakesurl: http://localhost:4000url: //cooldude.github.iourl:Google Analytics and Webmaster ToolsGoogle Analytics UA and Webmaster Tool verification tags can be entered under owner in _config.yml. For more information on obtaining these meta tags check Google Webmaster Tools and Bing Webmaster Tools support.Navigation LinksTo set what links appear in the top navigation edit _data/navigation.yml. Use the following format to set the URL and title for as many links as you’d like. External links will open in a new window.- title: Portfolio  url: /portfolio/- title: Made Mistakes  url: http://mademistakes.comAdding New Content with OctopressWhile completely optional, I’ve included Octopress and some starter templates to automate the creation of new posts and pages. To take advantage of it start by installing the Octopress gem if it isn’t already.$ gem install octopressNew PostDefault command$ octopress new post \"Post Title\"Default works great if you want all your posts in one directory, but if you’re like me and want to group them into subfolders like /posts, /portfolio, etc. Then this is the command for you. By specifying the DIR it will create a new post in that folder and populate the categories: YAML with the same value.$ octopress new post \"New Portfolio Post Title\" --dir portfolioNew PageTo create a new page use the following command.$ octopress new page new-page/This will create a page at /new-page/index.mdLayouts and ContentExplanations of the various _layouts included with the theme and when to use them.Post and PageThese two layouts are very similar. Both have an author sidebar, allow for large feature images at the top, and optional Disqus comments. The only real difference is the post layout includes related posts at the end of the page.Post Index PageA sample index page listing all posts grouped by the year they were published has been provided. The name can be customized to your liking by editing a few references. For example, to change Posts to Writing update the following:In _config.yml under links: rename the title and URL to the following:  links:  - title: Writing    url: /writing/  Rename posts/index.md to writing/index.md and update the YAML front matter accordingly.  Update the View all posts link in the post.html layout found in _layouts to match title and URL set previously.Feature ImagesA good rule of thumb is to keep feature images nice and wide so you don’t push the body text too far down. An image cropped around around 1024 x 256 pixels will keep file size down with an acceptable resolution for most devices. If you want to serve these images responsively I’d suggest looking at the Jekyll Picture Tag plugin1.The post and page layouts make the assumption that the feature images live in the images/ folder. To add a feature image to a post or page just include the filename in the front matter like so. It’s probably best to host all your images from this folder, but you can hotlink from external sources if you desire.image:  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg  thumb: thumbnail-image.jpg #keep it square 200x200 px is goodTo add attribution to a feature image use the following YAML front matter on posts or pages. Image credits appear directly below the feature image with a link back to the original source if supplied.image:  feature: feature-image-filename.jpg  credit: Michael Rose #name of the person or site you want to credit  creditlink: http://mademistakes.com #url to their site or licensingThumbnails for OG and Twitter CardsFeature and thumbnail images are used by Open Graph and Twitter Cards as well. If you don’t assign a thumbnail the default graphic (default-thumb.png) is used. I’d suggest changing this to something more meaningful — your logo or avatar are good options.Pro-Tip: You need to apply for Twitter Cards before they will begin showing up when links to your site are shared.Author OverrideBy making use of data files you can assign different authors for each post.Start by modifying authors.yml file in the _data folder and add your authors using the following format.# Authorsbilly_rick:  name        : \"Billy Rick\"  web         : \"http://thewhip.com\"  email       : \"billy@rick.com\"  bio         : \"What do you want, jewels? I am a very extravagant man.\"  avatar      : \"bio-photo-2.jpg\"  twitter     : \"extravagantman\"  google_plus : \"BillyRick\"cornelius_fiddlebone:  name        : \"Cornelius Fiddlebone\"  email       : \"cornelius@thewhip.com\"  bio         : \"I ordered what?\"  avatar      : \"bio-photo.jpg\"  twitter     : \"rhymeswithsackit\"  google_plus : \"CorneliusFiddlebone\"To assign Billy Rick as an author for our post. We’d add the following YAML front matter to a post:author: billy_rickKramdown Table of ContentsTo include an auto-generated table of contents for posts and pages, add the following _include before the actual content. Kramdown will take care of the rest and convert all headlines into list of links.{% include toc.html %}Paragraph IndentationBy default the margin below paragraphs has been removed and indent added to each. This is an intentional design decision to mimic the look of type set in a printed book or manuscript.    Example of the default paragraph style (indented first line and bottom margin removed).To disable the indents and add spacing between paragraphs change the following line in _sass/variables.scss from true !default to false like so.$paragraph-indent: false;    Example of paragraphs with $paragraph-indent disabled.VideosVideo embeds are responsive and scale with the width of the main content block with the help of FitVids.Not sure if this only effects Kramdown or if it’s an issue with Markdown in general. But adding YouTube video embeds causes errors when building your Jekyll site. To fix add a space between the &lt;iframe&gt; tags and remove allowfullscreen. Example below:&lt;iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"http://www.youtube.com/embed/PWf4WUoMXwg\" frameborder=\"0\"&gt; &lt;/iframe&gt;Social Sharing LinksSocial sharing links for Twitter, Facebook, and Google+ are included on posts/pages by default. To hide them on specific posts or pages add share: false to the YAML Front Matter. If you’d like to use different social networks modify _includes/social-share to your liking. Icons are set using Font Awesome.Further CustomizationJekyll 2.x added support for Sass files making it much easier to modify a theme’s fonts and colors. By editing values found in _sass/variables.scss you can fine tune the site’s colors and typography.For example if you wanted a red background instead of white you’d change $bodycolor: #fff; to $bodycolor: $cc0033;.To modify the site’s JavaScript files I setup a Grunt build script to lint/concatenate/minify all scripts into scripts.min.js. Install Node.js, then install Grunt, and then finally install the dependencies for the theme contained in package.json:npm installFrom the theme’s root, use grunt concatenate JavaScript files, and optimize .jpg, .png, and .svg files in the images/ folder. You can also use grunt dev in combination with jekyll build --watch to watch for updates JS files that Grunt will then automatically re-build as you write your code which will in turn auto-generate your Jekyll site when developing locally.            If you’re using GitHub Pages to host your site be aware that plugins are disabled. You’ll need to build your site locally and then manually deploy if you want to use this sweet plugin. &#8617;      ","categories": [],

Lhasa is the capital city of Tibet, and apso is a word in the Tibetan language meaning “bearded”, so, Lhasa Apso simply means “long-haired Lhasa dog”.

One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother.

You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.This post has a manual excerpt &lt;!--more--&gt; set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:excerpt_separator: \"&lt;!--more--&gt;\"If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.","categories": ["Post Formats"],

        "excerpt":"This post has reading time disabled. The estimated time that it takes to read this post should not be showing if read_time: false is set in _config.yml or in this post’s YAML Front Matter.If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"DefaultThis is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.Left AlignThis is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.Center AlignThis is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.Right AlignThis is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.Justify AlignThis is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.","categories": ["Markup"],

Grab a paddle and let’s get started.The image above happens to be centered. The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thing. Mission accomplished!And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah — Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!    Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.The figure above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.    Itty-bitty caption.The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.As you can see the should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image.

Massive image comment for your eyeballs.The figure element above has an inline style of width: 1200px set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.

        "excerpt":"Jekyll themes distributed as Ruby gems are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to “install it”. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to “upgrade it”.If you’re interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:  Support for a theme assets folder was recently added to Jekyll core, but has yet to be released or rolled into the github-pages gem. Meaning you can’t use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet… locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don’t mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.  Windows users can’t currently use themes packaged as gems due to a bug with file paths in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a fix is on the way soon.Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue.If you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the _includes, _layouts, _sass partials, or assets this should be quick and painless.Step 1: Remove Theme FilesRemove _includes, _layouts, _sass, assets folders and files within. You won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled in the theme.If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as overrides to the versions bundled with the theme.Step 2: Update GemfileIn order to test you’ll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes.Start by replacing gem \"github-pages\" or gem \"jekyll\" with the following:gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem:gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"`When finished your Gemfile should look something like this:source \"https://rubygems.org\"gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"group :jekyll_plugins do  # gem \"jekyll-archives\"  gem \"jekyll-paginate\"  gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"  gem \"jekyll-gist\"  gem \"jekyll-feed\"  gem \"jemoji\"endStep 3: Run BundlerRun bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems.Step 4: Install the ThemeAdd theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" to your _config.yml file.If you’re migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn’t have to change anything else after this. If it’s a new site consult then docs to properly config.Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now assets/images but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml.Step 5: jekyll new TweaksIf this is a new site be sure to add the following files to _data/ and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.  _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation  _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentationYou’ll also need to:  Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.html with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html.  Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.  Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using).That’s it!
