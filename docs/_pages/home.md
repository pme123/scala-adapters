**This is work in progress! So there is a lot stuff missing and may not be totally accurate.**

As a server developer I am looking for an easy way to provide a GUI for my server projects. 
This projects uses a **Scala full-stack**, that is for now the best way do achieve that. 

**This Project has the following purpose:**
* Try this Scala full-stack in a productive project.
* Get some experience in moving to open source.
* Using free open source tools and technologies (like Jekyll and this theme;). 

**The focus is on:**
* the interaction between the server and the client (shared).
* the client

For the server part just check the Play documentation.

**The documentation is organized in 4 views:**
1. [Business View](docs/business-view/)
1. [Architecture & Design View](docs/architecture-view/)
1. [Development View](docs/development-view/)
1. [Deployment View](docs/deployment-view/)
