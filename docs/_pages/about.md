Scala Adapters is a simple framework to implement batch jobs written in Scala. 

**Opinionated** as it defines:
* The technology stack
* The project setup

## Notable Features

- Setup and running in 5 minutes.
- Compatible with a Scala/ Play project.
- By default no shared- and client implementation needed.
- Styling with [Semantic-UI][Semantic] is setup and ready to use.
- Binding.scala allows you to work with type-safe XHTML tags.

## Examples

| Github                                           | Demo                                                                                                | Description                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [scala-adapters][scala-adapters]                 | [demo][demo] :: [cockpit-demo][demo_cockpit] :: [results-demo][demo_results]                            | scala-adapters includes a demo project that shows the main features.                                 |
| [scala-adapters-example][scala-adapters-example] | [demo-example][demo_example]                                                                        | scala-adapters-example shows a minimal project that is identical to a newly one created with giter8. |
| [scala-adapters-images][scala-adapters-images]   | [images][demo_images] :: [cockpit-images][demo_images_cockpit] :: [results-images][demo_images_results] | scala-adapters-images has a simple process that sends a flag to switch the page (Emojis or Photos).  |
